Folks,my first time posting - have a bit of Unix experience, but am new to Linux.Just got a new PC at home - Dell box with Windows XP. Added a second hard disk for Linux. Partitioned the disk and have installed Suse 7.2 from CD, which went fine except it didn't pick up my monitor. I have a Dell branded E151FPp 15" LCD flat panel monitor and a nVidia GeForce4 Ti4200 video card, both of which are probably too new to feature in Suse's default set. I downloaded a driver from the nVidia website and installed it using RPM. Then I ran Sax2 (as was recommended in some postings I found on the net), but it still doesn't feature my video card in the available list. What next? Another problem. I have a Dell branded keyboard and if I hit Caps-Lock twice, the whole machine crashes (in Linux, not Windows) - even the on/off switch is inactive, leaving me to reach for the power cable instead.If anyone can help me in any way with these probs., I'd be really grateful - I've searched the 'net but have run out of ideas.Or should I be going for a different version of Linux such as RedHat? Opinions welcome.Thanks a lot,Peter
I am wondering whether there's a way that I can use sitescooper and/or plucker or some other free utility to convert word documents into something a bit more palmos friendly? I don't have a Windows machine, so it becomes problematic to convert them; I know that if this were not the case, in Word I could save them as some other more friendly format.
